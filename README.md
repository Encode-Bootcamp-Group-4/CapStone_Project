__Project Description__

Proof of Snake is a Web3-ified version of the classic game Snake. The game allows users to bet GoerliETH and play a game of Snake. The score from the game is stored on our smart contract, along with the gameId and bet size. A challenger can then challenge the game, and if they win, they get the GoerliETH from the original player. If the original player wins, they get to keep the GoerliETH. The game is played on a 42x42 grid, and the snake can move in any direction. The snake can't move through the walls, and the snake can't eat itself. The snake can also eat the food, which will increase the length of the snake. The game ends when the snake hits itself or the wall. The score is the length of the snake at the end of the game. 

__Project Context__

This is an demo app for the Encode bootcamp CapStone project for Group 4. The goal of the project is to create a game that uses a smart contract to store the score of the game, and allows users to bet on the game. The game must be provably fair, and the smart contract must be able to verify the score of the game.
